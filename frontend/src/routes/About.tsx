        I've been coding now for about 3 years. Most of my experience has been
        in building backend services for search applications. I recently started
        doing a lot of work building serverless apps. In order to stay motivated
        with my personal projects, I decided to start this blog to get in the
        habit of writing more often. My first project is to build a serverless
        blog which will be this site that you are on right now. Then, I'll move
        on to other ideas that I will also share here. I hope you enjoy reading
        about my journey on this blog.

        Before switching to coding, I was a structural engineer for about 6
        years. Although I enjoyed working on the structural design of buildings,
        I have always wanted to dive into building websites and apps. Hopefully,
        I'll have the chance to work on buildings and houses again in the
        future, but with automation and AI. If you are a civil/structural
        engineer and have questions about getting into tech, send me an email at
        nguyenposts@gmail.com. Making the switch can seem scary but if any part
        of you thinks it's a good fit, I would be happy to help by answering any
        of your questions.
